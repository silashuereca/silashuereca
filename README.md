## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me. I love building. From when I was a kid I built various things like a three story treehouse between two big trees, a remote controlled car, furniture and even a trap my dad fell in (he was okay) :D I believe this is why I fell in love with writing software because itâ€™s endless on what you can build and itâ€™s free for the most part! Iâ€™m a Founding Engineer for [Momentum](https://www.momentum.io/) and I get to work with some of the best engineers. One of my passions is teamwork and building projects with others! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [FitCAP](https://www.fitcap.io) that's built on Next.js/Supabase which now has over 120 active users!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about PostgreSQL and good Database design practices
